## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ and npm installed
- Modern web browser

### Installation

#### Frontend
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
2. Start Vite:
```bash
npm run dev
```
3. Visit `http://localhost:5173`

#### Backend (new)
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd server
npm install
```
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in `MONGODB_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, and `CLIENT_ORIGIN`.
3. Run the API:
```bash
npm run dev
```
4. The frontend expects `VITE_API_URL` (see `.env.example`) to point at `http://localhost:4000/api` by default.

> Tip: run both servers simultaneously with separate terminals (or add a root script using `concurrently` if you prefer).

## Data Storage

This MVP uses **localStorage** for data persistence. Data is stored in the browser and includes:

- `lnf_users` - User accounts with authentication
- `lnf_items` - Lost and found item posts
- `lnf_messages` - User conversations (for future messaging)
- `lnf_current_user` - Currently logged-in user session

**Important**: Data is stored locally in your browser. Clearing browser data will delete all posts and accounts.

## Features Implemented

✅ User authentication with email/password
✅ Sign up with student email validation (.edu domain)

## Sample Data

The app comes pre-loaded with 2 sample items:
1. A found iPhone 13 near the library
2. A lost student ID card between cafeteria and dorm

You can browse these items without creating an account, but you'll need to sign up to post new items.
